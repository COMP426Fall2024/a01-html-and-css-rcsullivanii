            <p>Achilles was the greatest warrior of all the Greek forces in Troy. His allegience, however, was not
                resolute. As detailed in Homer's <em>Illiad</em>, Achilles was a loose cannon whose actions had major
                consequences for both armies. </p>

                    <strong>Dispute with Agamemnon</strong>: Achilles clashed with Greek commander Agamemnon and,

                <li>
                    <strong>Patroclus' Death</strong>: While Achilles remained out of battle, his close friend Patroclus
                    pretended to be him to rally the Greek armies. Patroclus fought bravely but was killed by Trojan
                    pince Hector.

                <li>
                    <strong>Achilles Returns to Battle</strong>: Enraged by Patroclus' death, Achilles rejoined the war

                    gates of Troy. After slaying Hector, Achilles dishonored his body by dragging it behind
                    his chariot.

                <li>
