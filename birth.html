        <h1>The Birth of Achilles</h1>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Achilles was one of the greatest heroes in all of Greek mythology. The warrior was born to Peleus, the
                king of the Myrmidons, and Thetis, a beautiful sea nymph. </p>

            <p>According to the myth, Thetis tried to make Achilles immortal by dipping him into the River Styx. Thetis,
                however, overlooked the fact that her young baby's entire body must be consumed by the river's magical
                waters when she held him by his heel. This untouched heel would later become his fatal weakness — the
                famed <strong>Achilles’ heel.</strong></p>

            <p>When Achilles was a child, he was sent to be raised by Chiron, the wise centaur who taught the likes of
                Hercules and Jason. Now trained in the arts of war and medicine, Achilles became a formidable warrior
                who would serve a key role in the Trojan War. </p>

            <p>In no time, Achilles grew up to be the most skilled warrior of his generation. His legendary striking
                speed made him nearly unbeatable in battle, but his fate was sealed by a prophecy: he would either
                live a long, quiet life or a short, glorious one that would make his name immortal.</p>
